# Introduction
Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) play a significant role in the regulation of various diseases and drug responses. However, the complex interactions among ncRNAs and their biological relevance are often overlooked. This study aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel method called ncGRaph. ncGRaph (a) provides a large-scale collection of ncRNA complex interaction datasets, encompassing circRNA/LncRNA-miRNA interactions, ncRNAs-mRNA/protein-disease interactions, and ncRNAs-mRNA/protein-drug interactions; (b) constructs a comprehensive knowledge graph of experiment-validated ncRNA interactome, enabling accurate prediction of potential ncRNA-disease associations and ncRNA-drug associations using deep learning techniques; and (c) develops a user-friendly visualization platform that presents both experimentally verified and predicted ncRNA interaction networks. This platform facilitates the mechanistic study of ncRNA function and offers new avenues for targeted treatments. By considering the intricate ncRNA interactions, ncGRaph contributes to a deeper understanding of RNA-based therapeutic interventions.
